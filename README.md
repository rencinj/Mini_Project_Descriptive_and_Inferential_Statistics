# 📊 Descriptive & Inferential Statistics – Mini Project

This project is designed to help learners build a solid foundation in both descriptive and inferential statistics. It covers theoretical understanding and practical computation using real-world datasets.

---

## 📝 Project Overview

This mini project blends basic statistical theory with practical exercises. Students will learn to summarize, interpret, and infer data using techniques like central tendency, dispersion, confidence intervals, and hypothesis testing.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Understand statistical concepts and classifications
- Manually compute statistical measures like mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation
- Estimate population parameters using confidence intervals
- Apply hypothesis testing to support data-driven decisions

---

## 📚 Key Concepts Covered

- **Descriptive Statistics**: Mean, Median, Mode, Range, Variance, Standard Deviation, IQR
- **Inferential Statistics**: Confidence Interval, Hypothesis Testing (Z-test)
- **Data Types & Levels of Measurement**: Nominal, Ordinal, Interval, Ratio
- **Basic Statistical Definitions**: Population, Sample, Parameter, Statistic
